In the demanding world of software engineering, it’s essential to acknowledge the importance of cognitive load on developers when introducing new tools or processes. Often, the rationale behind implementing a complex system is the belief that developers, being highly intelligent, can manage it. However, this perspective overlooks a fundamental insight: their intelligence is a finite, precious resource that should be deployed on tasks that yield the highest business value, like crafting innovative technical solutions.  
  
Managing cognitive load effectively means recognizing that every new tool or process introduced should not just be about whether developers can adapt, but whether they should have to. It’s about conserving their mental energy for where it truly counts - on creativity and problem-solving that drives our business forward. It’s extremely important to ensure that their talents are used in the most impactful way possible.
